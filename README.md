# Guerrilla Ticket

Openly-licensed and completely unapproved resources to call out vehicle owners while supporting good causes.

- [x] Get it off your chest
- [x] Give them a spook when they see a ticket
- [x] Encourage them to donate to a good cause!

Guerrilla Ticket was created after years of frustration seeing people disregard the law and common courtesy at apartment complexes, schools, and other public buildings. Rather than calling the cops (unnecessary escalation) or vandalism (tempting, but illegal!), issue a Guerrilla Ticket to try and make the world a tiny bit better.

## Printing Tips

For the best results, we recommend the following:

- [x] JavaScript is required to automatically duplicate the page (to print 4 copies to a page)
- [x] Use the most fluorescent paper you can find, e.g. bright orange
- [x] Uncheck "Print headers and footers" (or similar)
- [x] Check "Print backgrounds" (or similar)
- [x] Play with the options for pages per sheet and margins to get the right size; examples are designed around **US Letter** size paper with **four pages per sheet**
